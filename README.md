Tagging
=======

Tagging is a plugin for [Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org) that
can be used to organize torrents by assigning multiple tags to them. It was
based on LabelPlus 0.3.1.0 by Ratanak Lun, which in turn was
based on Label 0.2 by Martijn Voncken.

Much of the advanced functionality were removed, as the main purpose of
this plugin is to provide for the single missing thing: multiple tags
per torrent.
